# Housing prices in California

The objective of this project is to go through the different steps of a machine learning project and get familiarized with them. The different steps will be added here as I go through the steps.

### - Big picture of the project:

Before the data is gathered of any algorithm is applied, we most first look
at the big picture of the project and ask ourselves several questions about it.
 - What is the frame of the project, its reason
 - How it fits an actual solution? (if there is any available)
 - What kind of problem should it tackle?
    - Supervised/unsupervised, etc.
    - Regression or classification, or ...
    - What learning technique should be applied (online, batch, etc.)
